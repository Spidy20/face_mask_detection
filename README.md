## Installation
- Install Anaconda(`Python 3.7`) & Tensorflow GPU (`I used 1.15 TF`)
- First Download Object Detecion official code from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
- Then Download this Repository via GIT or zip.
- Download [Training.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CJlYHoyAr18jjimE0x4H-1WjpE5VJZOO)
- In my Repository extract `Training.zip.
- Now copy all the files & folders from my repository.
- Go to the `master/research/object_detection` and paste all files & folders of my repository to there.
- Open `face_mask_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter and give the image in which you want to detect Mask(Mentioned in code).

## What I did??

- This is already prepared which I given to you. But behind of these I created my own image dataset, then did Image Labelling,Model configuration.
- After that I used `Faster_rcnn_v2` model and I trained it around 4 hours. At the end i got a loss of `0.053`.
- Model is trained os NVIDA 920MX 2GB(used TensorFlow-GPU with CUDA) 
- So guys I given lots of efforts to complete this project. So please Starüåü my  repository and follow me.
- If you have any queries the you can ask me on my [Insta Community Page](https://www.instagram.com/machine_learning_hub.ai)
